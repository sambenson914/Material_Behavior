# Material_Behavior
Characterize behavior of materials by fitting parameters to test data.

Stress-strain workflow:
1. Chose tensile profiles in the "images" folder.
2. Converted the images to datasets using PlotDigitizer in the "data" folder.
3. Optimized parameters for the elastic and plastic regions using my optimization method in "source".
4. Parameters and fits were output in the "results" folder.
